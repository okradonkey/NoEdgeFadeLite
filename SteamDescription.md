Man-made tiles no longer fade out when bordering other terrain types -
instead, they will have distinct, crisp edges.  Borders between two
natural terrains will still be faded.

If you want ALL terrain borders (except natural shorelines) to be crisp,
check out the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027252699]No Edge Fade[/url] mod.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Compatible with RimWorld v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, and the Royalty DLC.
- No game-breaking incompatibilities, [b]BUT...[/b]

This mod drastically re-orders the rendering precedence of terrains.
Floors and terrains added by other mods will probably not match this new
order.  Worst case scenario, their terrain borders might fade when they
shouldn't, or vice versa.

Good news, though: This mod can be easily updated to fix these issues.
Please feel free to make a compatibility request for any mods you like.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
Rough, hewn, and smooth stone floors are hard-coded and can't be
modified by XML.  As a result, they may have some faded borders.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just changes the renderPrecedence 
  and edgeType of terrains.
